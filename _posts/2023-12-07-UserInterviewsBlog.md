# Intro To Conducting User Interviews

## Overview
According to the Interaction Design Foundation, “User research is the methodic study of target users — including their 
needs and pain points — so designers have the sharpest possible insights to work with to make the best designs.”

User research is an integral part of the design process in not only defining who the user’s are, but also the differences 
between what they want and what they need. There are several different research methods to collect research data during 
this discovery phase. The following lists a few examples:

1. Stakeholder Interviews
2. Subject matter expert interviews
3. User and customer interviews
4. Contextual interviews (ethnographic studies)
5. Diary studies
6. Focus groups

In this section, we will dive deeper into number 3, user and customer interviews.

## Understanding the User

First, it is important to understand the difference between the user and the customer. While many people group the two terms, 
there is a nuanced difference between the two. The customers are the decision makers, meaning that they pay the bill, but does 
not necessarily mean that they are the users. A good example of this is in the case of a university providing services for their 
students. For instance, a college could be the customer for a software, but the actual users of the product would be the students 
themselves. In order to conduct successful research, it is important to understand both the needs of the customer and the user.

Second, consider the persona hypothesis. Who might use this product? How might their needs and behaviors vary? What types of environments 
might this product be used in? Interview a variety of different people to gain different perspectives.

## Interview Techniques

After gaining a clearer understanding of who your users and customers are, it is time to conduct the interview. One of the most crucial 
aspects of interviewing is to ask open ended questions. Essentially, the goal is to guide the user and let the user tell their story 
instead of leading the conversation in a desired direction. Avoid questions that start with “do you” or “would you” and instead opt for 
questions that start with “how”, “what”, “where”, “who”. Asking the user to explain things to you reveals more than asking simple, 
leading questions. Instead of asking “do you like this app’s features?”, ask “tell me more about your experience using this app”. Make
the interview a conversation, not an interrogation. Getting a story from the user is better information than getting statements. Try to 
get an understanding of **why**. Understanding the goals and motivations of users is essential to crafting innovation.

While interview questions should be tailored to your product/service, there are several general essential interview topics that should be 
considered:

#### Activities
1. What are the key tasks and activities?
2. Why are they important (or are they important)? What is the end-goal?
3. How often are they performed?

#### Frustrations
1. Ask about both likes and dislikes
2. Try to understand what pain points users currently have and why.
3. Understanding user frustrations is often helpful in getting at root goals and aspirations.

#### Skills
1. What relevant knowledge and skill sets do users have?
2. Where do they struggle and why?

Consider this case here: suppose you were conducting an interview to gather intel for user research regarding your new app that is used 
to help tourists explore a new location. What questions could you ask? Other than asking for the interviewee’s basic information such as 
age and occupation, you could ask “walk me through the steps you talk when you arrive in a new vacation area” or “tell me about your 
experience using vacation planning apps/websites”. 

## Logistics
In terms of logistics, make sure to ask the same questions in each user interview. While asking follow up questions is encouraged to 
promote storytelling, keep on track and do not flow off topic. In a more professional setting, oftentimes is it critical to ask the user 
if you can record the session. This is not only to make sure you have permission, but also so that you can go back and review answers. 
Occasionally, there would be a form of compensation for the interviewee’s time.

After gathering both quantitative and qualitative data from your user interview, you can begin to transition into analysis: creating user 
personas and subsequently journey maps.
